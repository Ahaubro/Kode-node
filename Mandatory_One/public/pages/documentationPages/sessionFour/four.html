    <h3>Static files in Express</h3>

    <p> "Express, by default does not allow you to serve static files. 
        You need to enable it using the following built-in middleware."

        In the line below, you can see a code example of how we can serve static files in Express.

        <br/>

        <p2> app.use(express.static("public")); </p2>

        This will allow us to serve static files in our public folder.

    <h3>Implement SSR project</h3>

    <p> In my file "app.js" in this project, i have implemted SSR, by creating a components folder
        containing my nav.html (My nav bar & header) and my footer.html. This structure makes it possible for all
        my html files to use this header and footer. I have also made a replaceable title that we learned in 
        class by adding <p2> %%TITLE_PLACEHOLDER%% </p2> in my nav title:

        In the following lines i will show a code snippet, that changes the title for my session one page(one.html):
        <br/>
        
        <p2> const pageOne = nav.replace("%%TITLE_PLACEHOLDER%%", "Intro") + one + footer; </p2>

        <br>
