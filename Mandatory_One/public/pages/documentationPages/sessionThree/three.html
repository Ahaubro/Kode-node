    <h3>Nodemon</h3>

    <p>Nodemon is a gift to developers. We can use nodemon to continuously build our project, so we dont
        have to rerun our project, to use the changes we are making automatically.

    <h3>Implement a RestAPI</h3>

    <p> The link will take you to my RestAPI about beers on github,
        where you can see how to implement a RestAPI with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH & DELETE methods.

<div id="get">

    <h3>Get requests</h3>

    <p> When sending data to our server with a GET method,
        we need to use a pathvariable or a query String to send data. 
        <nav>
            <li>Path variable - We can use a path variable in our endpoint, by adding it to the path after -> "app.get('/beers/:id', (req, res) =>"</li>
            <li>Query String - We can use a query String, by using key & value in a url. When our path ends, we can write the query String
                ?key=value&key2=value2
            </li>

        </nav>
    </p>
