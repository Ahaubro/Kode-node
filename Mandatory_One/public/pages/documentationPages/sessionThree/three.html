    <h3>Nodemon</h3>

    <p>Nodemon is a gift to developers. We can use nodemon to continuously build our project, so we dont
        have to rerun our project, to use the changes we are making automatically. 
        The nodemon tool helps develop node.js applications by automatically restarting the application 
        when changes are detected in the files.
        To use nodemon we follow these steps:

    </p>
    <br/>
    <nav class="navPadding">
        <li> <p2> npm install -g nodemon</p2></li>
        <li> <p2> npx nodemon </p2></li>

    </nav>

    <h3>Implement a RestAPI</h3>

    <p> When implementing a RestApi it needs to be possible to make CRUD operations.
        This is why it is neccesary to make the methods I mentioned in <a href="/one">Session 1 - Rest Api</a>.

        This link will take you to my RestAPI about beers on github,
        where you can see how to implement a RestAPI with GET(findAll & findByID), 
        POST(Create), PUT(Update object), PATCH(Update object partially) & DELETE methods.
        In this project you will find a PATCH and a PUT method, but we have learned that it is not
        necessary to have both.

<div id="get" class="box-bottom-shadow">

    <h3>Get requests</h3>

    <p> When sending data to our server with a GET method,
        we need to use a pathvariable or a query String to send data. 
        <nav class="navPadding">
            <li>
                Path variable - We can use a path variable in our endpoint, by adding it to the path: 
                <p2> app.get('/beers/:id', (req, res) => </p2>

            </li>
            <li>Query String - We can use a query String, by using key & value in a url. When our path ends, 
                we can write the query String <p2> ?key=value&key2=value2 </p2>
            </li>

        </nav>
    </p>
