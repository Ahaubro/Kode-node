    <h3>Clean code and code conventions</h3>

    <p>Clean code is important, because of many reasons.
       But the most important being, that your code will be
       much easier to read and understand for another developer.
       Here is som rules to remember: 
    </p>

    <nav>
        <li>Structure is key</li>
        <li>Name variables so they make sense</li>
    </nav>

<div id="callbacks">
    <h3>Callbacks</h3>

    <p>There are three ways to define a callback function in JS.
        <nav>
            <li>Arrow function - app.get("/", (req, res) => {
                res.send(frontpagePage);
            }); - This is a simple arrow callback, where the method body is defined in the {}
            after the arrow "=>".</li>
            <li>Anonymous function - app.get("/terminalCommands", function (req, res) {
                res.send(terminalCommandsPage);
            })</li>
            <li>Named function refference - By using the name of a predefined named function.</li>
        </nav>
    </p>

<div id="express">
    <h3>Create a server with Express</h3>

    <p>To create a server with Express, we first make a new project,
        and create a package.json file, which contains a pair of empty
        curly brackets. We then type npm install express in the console.
        When npm finishes the installation, we will have a folder "node modules" and a package lock file.
        Then i will start on my app.js file, see the code snips below. 
    </p>
